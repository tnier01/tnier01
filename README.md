### Hi there 👋

I am a master student at the [Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/index.html), where I also work as a research assistant. As a member in the research project [Opening Reproducible Research (o2r)](https://o2r.info/), I develop possibilities to improve reproducible research with an [OJS plugin](https://github.com/o2r-project/ojs-erc-plugin). By further pursuing study projects of the master program supported by university funding programs, I am developing a [smart bird feeder](https://github.com/CountYourBirds) in a group of three students to push biodiversity monitoring using artificial intelligence.
