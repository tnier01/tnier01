### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a master student at the [Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/index.html), where I also work as a research assistant. As a member in the research project [senseBox](https://github.com/sensebox), I develop open science based educational technologies. By further pursuing study projects of the master program supported by university funding programs, I am developing a [smart bird feeder](https://github.com/CountYourBirds) in a group of three students to push biodiversity monitoring using artificial intelligence.
