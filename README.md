### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a master student at the [Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/index.html), where I also work as a research assistant. As a member of the research project [TinyAIoT](https://sensebox.de/de/research-tinyaiot) associated to the [senseBox](https://github.com/sensebox) project, I develop energy and resource efficient IoT applications and open science based educational technologies. By further pursuing study projects of the master program supported by university funding programs, I am developing a [smart bird feeder]([https://github.com/CountYourBirds](https://github.com/Birdiary)) to push biodiversity monitoring using artificial intelligence.
